                <p>Elon Musk is one of the most popular names in the tech industry today. Running various businesses,
                    Musk is often making news for one venture or another. The Tesla and X (earlier called Twitter) chief
                    is among the top 5 richest people in the world and has often topped the list as well. Snippets from
                    Musk's early life and career often make their way on the internet, which give us a glimpse about who
                    he was before becoming the billionaire entrepreneur that he is today</p>
